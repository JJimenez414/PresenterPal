## About The Project

The **PowerPoint Pal** is a dynamic add-in for Microsoft PowerPoint that empowers users to apply formatting changes to slides using natural language commands. Leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, this add-in interprets user instructions and applies precise formatting to specific shapes across multiple slides seamlessly.

## Starting Up

### Dependencies

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended): Download Node.js
npm (comes with Node.js)
Microsoft PowerPoint (Desktop version)
Setup Steps
Clone the Repository

### Installing

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root:

bash
Copy code
touch .env
Add your OpenAI API key to the .env file:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
Note: Replace your-openai-api-key-here with your actual OpenAI API key. Do not share this key publicly or commit it to version control.

Trust the Self-Signed Certificate (For Local Development)

Install and trust the certificates:

bash
Copy code
npx office-addin-dev-certs install
Follow the prompts to install and trust the certificates required for local development.

Build and Start the Project

bash
Copy code
npm run build
npm start
This will start the local server and open PowerPoint with the add-in sideloaded.
Sideload the Add-in Manually (If Necessary)

If the add-in doesn't load automatically:

In PowerPoint, go to Insert > My Add-ins > Manage My Add-ins.
Select Upload My Add-in > Browse.
Choose the manifest.xml file from the project directory.
Use the Add-in

In PowerPoint, open the add-in's task pane.
Enter a command in the input field (e.g., Create a slide about the Roman Empire).
Click Execute Command to see the results generated by the OpenAI API.
Security Reminder
Never expose your OpenAI API key in client-side code or commit it to any repository.
Keep the .env file private and consider adding it to your .gitignore file.
